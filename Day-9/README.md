# Employee Management System

This is a simple React project that displays employee information using JSX and dynamic rendering.

## How React and JSX are Used

- The project is built using React functional components.
- JSX is used to render elements in a syntax similar to HTML.
- JavaScript values are injected dynamically using curly braces `{}`.
- The `.map()` function loops through an array of employees and renders them dynamically.

## Components

- **`App.jsx`**: The main application component that renders `EmployeeDashboard`.
- **`EmployeeDashboard.jsx`**: Displays the list of employees dynamically.
- **`Header.jsx`**: Displays the title "Employee Management System."
- **`styles.css`**: Adds basic styling for better layout and readability.

## Challenges Faced

- Structuring components properly to maintain separation of concerns.
- Applying CSS styles to enhance the UI.
- Ensuring dynamic rendering of employee details using `.map()`.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the React app using `npm run dev` (for Vite) or `npm start` (for Create React App).
