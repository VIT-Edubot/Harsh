# Responsive Feedback Form

## Overview
This project is a responsive feedback form designed using HTML and CSS. The form is styled with a clean layout, ensuring usability across various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Well-spaced input fields, buttons, and labels for ease of use.
- **Styled Input Elements**: Text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, and text areas are properly formatted.
- **Button Styling**: Buttons are styled with a hover effect for better user experience.
- **Accessibility**: Ensures readability and easy interaction for all users.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (including media queries for responsiveness)

## Code Explanation
The form is wrapped within a `#feedback-form` container, which is styled with a fixed width and a centered layout to enhance readability. 

- **Global Styles**: `box-sizing: border-box` ensures padding and borders do not affect element width and height.
- **Form Styling**: The `#feedback-form` container has a border, padding, and background color to differentiate it from the page.
- **Input Fields**: All `input`, `select`, and `textarea` elements are given full width for consistency.
- **Radio and Checkbox Alignment**: Specific styles ensure radio buttons and checkboxes align properly with labels.
- **Buttons**: The submit button is centered and includes hover effects for better user interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: A media query adjusts the form layout for screens smaller than 600px, making buttons full width and ensuring stacked input fields.

## Installation & Usage
